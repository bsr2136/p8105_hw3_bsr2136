    ## Warning in dir.create("files_for_hw3"): 'files_for_hw3' already exists

## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

## The number of rows in the dataset is
nrow(instacart)
```

    ## [1] 1384617

``` r
## The number of columns in the dataset is
ncol(instacart)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
## The number of unique orders in the dataset is
length(unique(pull(instacart,order_id)))
```

    ## [1] 131209

``` r
##Which is equal to the number of unique users
length(unique(pull(instacart,user_id)))
```

    ## [1] 131209

``` r
## The number of unique products is
length(unique(pull(instacart,product_id)))
```

    ## [1] 39123

``` r
## The dataset gives information such as aisle and department of the
## product ordered. The departments are
unique(pull(instacart,department))
```

    ##  [1] "dairy eggs"      "produce"         "canned goods"   
    ##  [4] "beverages"       "deli"            "snacks"

    ## [19] "alcohol"         "bulk"            "pets"

``` r
## The dataset also gives the hour of day that the order was made
## The most common hour at which an order was made is
instacart %>% group_by(order_hour_of_day) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  .[1,1]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
