## Problem 1

### Describing the dataset

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

## The number of rows in the dataset is
nrow(instacart)
```

    ## [1] 1384617

``` r
## The number of columns in the dataset is
ncol(instacart)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
## The dataset has identifying information such as order, product, and user.
## The number of unique orders in the dataset is
length(unique(pull(instacart,order_id)))
```

    ## [1] 131209

``` r
##Which is equal to the number of unique users
length(unique(pull(instacart,user_id)))
```

    ## [1] 131209

``` r
## The number of unique products is
length(unique(pull(instacart,product_id)))
```

    ## [1] 39123

``` r
## The dataset gives information such as aisle and department of the
## product ordered. The departments are
unique(pull(instacart,department))
```

    ##  [1] "dairy eggs"      "produce"         "canned goods"   
    ##  [4] "beverages"       "deli"            "snacks"         
    ##  [7] "pantry"          "frozen"          "meat seafood"   
    ## [10] "household"       "bakery"          "personal care"  
    ## [13] "dry goods pasta" "babies"          "missing"        
    ## [16] "other"           "breakfast"       "international"  
    ## [19] "alcohol"         "bulk"            "pets"

``` r
## The dataset also gives the hour of day that the order was made
## The most common hour at which an order was made is
instacart %>% group_by(order_hour_of_day) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  .[1,1]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   order_hour_of_day
    ##               <int>
    ## 1                14

### Answering prompts about the dataset

1.  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

<!-- end list -->

``` r
## The number of aisles are
length(unique(pull(instacart,aisle)))
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
## And the aisles that the most items are ordered from are
instacart %>% group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##   aisle                              n
    ##   <chr>                          <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ## 4 yogurt                         55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese                41699
    ## 6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617

2.  Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
aisle_tbl <- instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n>=10000) %>%
  arrange(n)

aisle_tbl %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(pull(aisle_tbl,aisle),
                levels = pull(aisle_tbl,aisle)[order(pull(aisle_tbl,n))])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle,y=n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() + xlab("Aisle") + ylab("Number of Items Ordered")
```

3.  Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
baking <- instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>%
  group_by(aisle,product_name) %>%
  summarise(number_of_times_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_times_ordered)) %>%
  head(3)

dog_food <- instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "dog food care") %>%
  group_by(aisle,product_name) %>%
  summarise(number_of_times_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_times_ordered)) %>%
  head(3)

pack_veg <- instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>%
  group_by(aisle,product_name) %>%
  summarise(number_of_times_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_times_ordered)) %>%
  head(3)

rbind(baking,dog_food,pack_veg) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

4.  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
day_of_week <- instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
  group_by(product_name,order_dow) %>%
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow,
              values_from = mean_hour)

names(day_of_week)[2:8] <- c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday")

knitr::kable(day_of_week)
```

| product\_name    |   Sunday |   Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 |  15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 |  14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |
